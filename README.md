## A cross-platform Garry's Mod tool to download a server's Lua files

gluasteal downloads clientside & shared Lua files from Garry's Mod servers that you join. gluasteal also allows you to run your own Lua code on any server.

Tested & working on Windows & Linux. Still needs testing on Mac.

### How to Use

1. Either Download pre-built from the [Releases section](https://github.com/RavMda/glua-steal/releases) or [build from source](#Building-From-Source).
2. [Inject](#How-to-Inject) library into Garry's Mod, at the main menu.
3. Optionally, set up your [Lua file to be loaded](#lua-loader-load-before-autorun).
4. Join a server.

##### The gluasteal Directory

Logs and Lua files will be written to the gluasteal folder, in your home directory.

* Windows: C:/Users/username/Documents/gluasteal/
* Linux: /home/username/gluasteal/
* Mac: /Users/username/gluasteal/

### How to Inject

#### Windows

1. Get an injector
2. Add the dll to the injector
3. Select the Garry's Mod process
4. Inject at the main menu

#### Linux

##### Method 1

[linux-inject](https://github.com/gaffe23/linux-inject)

##### Method 2

Editing the Garry's Mod launch script (hl2.sh) to preload the gluasteal library.

`LD_PRELOAD=$LD_PRELOAD:/home/lewis/gluasteal.so`

##### Method 3

[Using gdb](https://github.com/AimTuxOfficial/AimTux/blob/master/load)

#### Mac

Using DYLD\_INSERT\_LIBRARIES (see LD\_PRELOAD above)

### Lua Loader (Load Before Autorun)

Place your Lua code in your [gluasteal directory](#The-gluasteal-Directory), in a file named gluasteal.lua
This file is executed in a separate environment, not in \_G. You are still able to access everything stored in \_G.

This file will be executed every time a Garry's Mod Lua script is about to be executed. You can return false to stop the current file (gluasteal.SCRIPT) from being executed.

You can also return a second bool to prevent gluasteal from saving the file.

```lua
-- All scripts with the string 'derma' in their name will be blocked from executing
if (gluasteal.SCRIPT:match("derma")) then
	return false, false
end
```
```lua
-- gluasteal.include example
-- runs "hook/newhook.lua" from your gluasteal folder, but gmod sees its path as "lua/includes/modules/hook.lua"
gluasteal.include('hook/newhook.lua', 'lua/includes/modules/hook.lua')
```
```
gluasteal.SCRIPT -- The path of the Garry's Mod Lua script that is about to be executed (e.g. "init.lua")
gluasteal.SOURCE -- The source code of the script that is about to be executed (e.g. "do return end")
gluasteal.VERSION -- The version of gluasteal being used
gluasteal.include -- A function to include other gluasteal Lua files, relative to the gluasteal directory - e.g. gluasteal.include("other.lua")
```

Note: gluasteal.SCRIPT and gluasteal.SOURCE will be an empty string in files included by gluasteal.include

---

### RunOnClient (Run clientside lua from menu)

You can use RunOnClient function in menu state to run clientside code.
Scripts runned with this method are also supplied with gluasteal table.
```lua
RunOnClient([[print('hello world!')]])
```

### Building From Source

If building with GCC, ensure you are using at least version 8 or above.

##### Windows

Using the Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt (requires VS build tools)

```
git clone https://github.com/RavMda/glua-steal
cd glua-steal
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir build
cd build
cmake --help	Find a suitable generator, such as "Visual Studio 15 2017"
cmake -A Win32 -G <GENERATOR> ..
msbuild gluasteal.sln /p:Configuration=Release
```

##### Unix
```
git clone https://github.com/RavMda/glua-steal
cd glua-steal
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
